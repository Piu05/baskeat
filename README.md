Hungry but only have a 10-min break? We got you!

## Introduction

BaskEat is a website designed for college students and it provides canteen and stationery facilities to them. The thought of making this website comes from the real-life situation of college students who often get very short breaks between lectures and can’t grab a bite if hungry. The time required to go to the canteen to order and then wait for the food is more than the time they have in their hands.

BaskEat aims to solve this problem by connecting the canteen of your college to the website so that you place your order in advance and collect it when it’s ready. It saves a lot of time and makes it easier for the students to grab a bite in a short break.
BaskEat also provides with stationery facility where you can purchase stationery items and print documents needed urgently over phone.
